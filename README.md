# Piazza Security Audit (2013)
This repo contains a report and slid deck presentation for a bug finding assignment completed in 2013 as part of an undergraduate information security course.  
I chose to audit the 3rd-party learning management tool we were using for the class: Piazza (https://piazza.com/).
Amongst my findings, the most severe was probably the ability to read private messages between other students and the instructor.
